This program is meant to take strike data calculated from the tensor components of AGG (Airborne Gravity Gradiometry) data and convert the point/grid calculations into lineations based on specified thresholding criteria. The program is based on the method described by Murphy and Brewster (2007). 

# Overview
This repository contains a Python program for extracting structural lineaments from point-based strike estimates, with a specific focus on strikes derived from Airborne Gravity Gradiometry (AGG) tensor data.

The program links strike-consistent points across adjacent survey lines using a directional, geometry-aware algorithm, producing lineaments that represent spatially coherent structural trends rather than isolated picks. It is designed for use in mineral exploration, regional structural interpretation, and crustal architecture analysis.

The workflow is particularly well suited to:
- AGG tensor-derived strikes (e.g. THG, curvature, eigenvector orientations)
- Wavelength-filtered datasets (e.g. high-pass vs band-pass)
- Interpretation within QGIS or similar GIS platforms

## How the program works
For each strike pick:

1. The program searches for a matching point on the next or previous survey line.

2. A candidate point is accepted if:
- it lies within a directional cone defined by the strike (e.g. ±10°),
- its own strike matches within a tolerance, and
- it lies within a maximum linking distance.
3. Only the best candidate per adjacent line is selected, preventing branching and zig-zagging.
4. Points are chained line-to-line, forming ordered lineaments with at most one point per line.
5. Short or weak chains are discarded based on a minimum number of points.

# Usage
## Input
The program takes an input CSV with the headers 
- Easting
- Northing
- Strike
- LineNumber

## Output
Three outputs are generated by the program:
1. ``lineaments_points.csv``
Ordered points belonging to each lineament
2. ``lineaments_segments.csv``
Segment-level representation of each lineament.
3. ``lineaments_summary.csv``
One record per lineament of the centre point, mean strike angle, length, and number of supporting points.

## Running the program
#### Basic example (CSV with standard headers)
``` bash
python lineaments.py input.csv 
```
